# AWS-Push-Notifications

#### Want to push notifications to your teams, or alert your customers/clients of an important update? Then this is the app framework you need!

#### I created an Andoird application framework backed by Google Firebase and AWS Services to push notifications to user endpoints!

<br>

The project utilizes: 
- Google Firebase  project services 
- Amazon AWS SNS Topics, SQS Queues, and Lambda Functions that use SNS points to invoke the Firebase Android services which are connected with the Android Studio Project. 
- Android Loaders, Fragments, Lifecycle methods, User Permissions, and also implements the Firebase Messaging Service
