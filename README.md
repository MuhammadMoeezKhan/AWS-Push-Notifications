# AWS-Push-Notifications

#### Want to push notifications to your teams, or alert your customers/clients of an important update? Then this is the app framework you need!

#### I created an Andoird application framework backed by Google Firebase and AWS Services to push notifications to user endpoints!

<br>

The project utilizes: 
- **Google Firebase**:  Cloud Messaging services to establish the connection between our server and user devices to deliver and receive messages.
- **Amazon AWS**: SNS Topics (that user devices subscribe to using their unique device tokens), SQS Queues, and Lambda Functions that use SNS endpoints to invoke the Firebase Android services connected with the Android Studio Project. 
- **Android Studio**: Android Loaders, Fragments, Lifecycle methods, User Permissions, Kotlin Plugins, and Android OOP Libraries.

##### As the users register their account and launch the application, the life cycle methods of a certain activity are called. These methods generate a unique code for each device that is copied to the developer's clipboard (just for demo, else sent directly to Firebase)
